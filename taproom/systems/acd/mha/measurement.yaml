  comment: "The results and uncertainties for the equilibrium constants and standard molar enthalpies of reaction in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained as weighted averages of the results of the titration experiments done for each (ligand + cyclodextrin) pair. These uncertainties refer to two estimated standard deviations of the mean. However, in some cases (see below), these uncertainties were increased to allow either for a minimal error in the calorimetric measurements or for impurities in the samples. The standard deviations of the mean are based on the scatter of the data in a single titration experiment and were obtained from the computer program “Origin”29 used to calculate the equilibrium constants and the standard molar enthalpies of reaction."
