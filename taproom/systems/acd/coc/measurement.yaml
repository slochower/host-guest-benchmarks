  comment: "The results and uncertainties for the equilibrium constants and standard molar enthalpies of reaction in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained as weighted averages of the results of the titration experiments done for each (ligand + cyclodextrin) pair. These uncertainties refer to two estimated standard deviations of the mean. However, in some cases (see below), these uncertainties were increased to allow either for a minimal error in the calorimetric measurements or for impurities in the samples. The standard deviations of the mean are based on the scatter of the data in a single titration experiment and were obtained from the computer program “Origin”29 used to calculate the equilibrium constants and the standard molar enthalpies of reaction."

unusual: True
comment: "Also, in some instances (e.g. cyclooctanol), the solubility of the ligand is limited. These factors all place limitations on the size of the measurable signal and can lead to larger uncertainties in the thermodynamic quantities."
